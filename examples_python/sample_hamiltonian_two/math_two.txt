Understanding the math for the two-qubit example

QUBO is 0 and 1

Ising is -1 and 1

The formula to relate them is 

Ising = 2 Qubo - 1

Solving for QUBO,

Qubo = 0.5 (Ising + 1)

Now, we're going to look at the two-qubit problem for which the opposite 
Qubo values (0 and 1, and 1 and 0) have lower energy than the solutions 
which have the same Qubo values (0 and 0, 1 and 1)

For this two-qubit problem, the objective is

Objective = 2 x y - x - y                                       (1)

Testing it,

X = 0, Y = 0, Qubo = 0
X = 1, Y = 0, Qubo = -1
X = 0, Y = 1, Qubo = -1
X = 1, Y = 1, Qubo = 0

which confirms that the two opposite Qubo solutions (0 and 1, 1 and 0) 
have lower energy.

We now convert to Ising, but making the substitution of the variable 
conversion (equation (1) above) into the Objective:

2 (0.5) (I + 1) (0.5) (J + 1) - 0.5 (I + 1) - 0.5 (J + 1)
0.5 (I + J + IJ + 1) - 0.5 I - 0.5 - 0.5 J - 0.5
0.5 I + 0.5 J + 0.5 IJ + 0.5 - 0.5 I - 0.5 - 0.5 J - 0.5
0.5 IJ  - 0.5

The resulting Ising model is:

Objective = 0.5 IJ - 0.5                             (2)

where I and J are Ising variables.

Testing the solution,

I = -1 J = -1 energy = 0
I = 1 J = -1 energy = -1
I = -1 J = 1 energy = -1
I = -1 J = -1 energy = 0

Now we need to put the Ising model objective into the Hamiltonian form
needed by the EQC1. The linear terms go downward in the first column, and 
then we put in the diagonal quadratic terms and off-diagonal quadratic terms.

The matrix should look like:

0.  0   0.25
0.  0.25   0

Thus, the needed Hamiltonian is:

(0, 2) = 0.25
(1, 1) = 0.25

Notice when these are added, they sum to the off-diagonal term 0.5 IJ.

Checking the solutions

The computer should find the solutions (1, -1) and (-1, 1), and they both
should have energy -0.5. The solutions should appear with equal probability.
