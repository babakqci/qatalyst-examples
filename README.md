# Examples on using Qatalyst from QCI

## Getting Started

To use these examples, install the necessary packages using `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
Each example is placed in a distinct jupyter notebook. There are assisting modules, such as `helpers.py` and
`data.py` which contain code and data necessary to utilize the examples, but are not explicitly defined
in the notebooks for clarity purposes. Examine these modules for to see how problems are modeled or visualized.

## Notebooks

### QAP (`qap-demo.ipynb`)

This example is a facility location problem directly from Koopmans and Beckmann (1957). It is a small example,
but one that demonstrates the utility of QUBO formulations well.

### TSP (`tsp-demo.ipynb`)

The TSP example is a random TSP with 8 nodes.
